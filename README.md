#  Introduction

*Gene Set Enrichment Analysis* (GSEA) is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. phenotypes).  See the [GSEA website](http://www.gsea-msigdb.org) for more details.

The GSEA LeadingEdgeReport module for GenePattern is a tool from the [GSEA Desktop](https://github.com/GSEA-MSigDB/gsea-desktop) used to build the Leading Edge Report, wrapped in a form suitable for [GenePattern](http://www.genepattern.org/), allowing it to be run on the GenePattern servers in a batch setting using a web UI, with no client installation. 

This module has never had a Production release.  It is part of the GSEA test suite and was designed exclusively with that in mind.  While it has been tested extensively for that use it has never been evaluated for any other purpose.

# License

The GSEA module for GenePattern is made available under the terms of a BSD-style license, a copy of which is included in the distribution in the [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) file.  See that file for exact terms and conditions.

The module relies upon the GSEA Desktop JAR.  See the [GSEA Desktop GitHub repository](https://github.com/GSEA-MSigDB/gsea-desktop) for information about its license.

#  Latest Version

No public binary releases of this software are available at this time; building from source is necessary for its use.

# History and Acknowledgments

The **GSEA Desktop application version 1.0** was developed by Aravind Subramanian as part of his PhD thesis.  The work was supported by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and advised by Jill Mesirov, Pablo Tamayo, Vamsi Mootha, Sayan Mukherjee, Todd Golub and Eric Lander.  See the README in the [GSEA Desktop GitHub repository](https://github.com/GSEA-MSigDB/gsea-desktop) for further history of the GSEA Desktop and list of additional contributors.

**The GSEA LeadingEdgeReport module for GenePattern** is based on the open-source GSEA Desktop v3.0 code base; the initial GitHub commit corresponds to the code base as of August 7, 2017. The earlier code revision history is not available.
  
David Eby was responsible for the open-source conversion of the GSEA Desktop and all the GSEA modules and handles current maintenance and new feature development.  While David is listed on the initial commit to this public GitHub repository, original authorship is due to the individuals listed in the GSEA history regardless of the GitHub history metadata.

The GSEA project is currently a joint effort of the Broad Institute and the University of California San Diego, and funded by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (PI: JP Mesirov).

# Dependencies

The GSEA Desktop and the GSEA LeadingEdgeReport module for GenePattern are 100% Pure Java.  Java 8 is required for our pre-built binaries.  Builds against other versions of Java may be possible but are unsupported.  **Oracle Java is recommended as there are known issues when running with OpenJDK.**

See the [LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.txt](LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.txt) file for a full list of the GSEA library dependencies.  In our GSEA Desktop binary builds, all required 3rd party library code is bundled into the single self-contained gsea-3.0.jar file so that no additional downloads or installation are required.  For the GenePattern module, additional library dependencies are included as separate files in the 'lib' directory.
